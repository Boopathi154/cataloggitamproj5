# EV Charging Station Finder and Slot Booking System

## Problem Statement

As electric vehicles (EVs) become more prevalent, the need for accessible and efficient charging infrastructure is critical. Drivers often face challenges in finding available charging stations and booking charging slots in advance, especially in areas with high EV traffic. A system that allows users to easily locate charging stations based on specific criteria and book a charging slot in advance would greatly enhance the user experience for EV owners.

## Solution

This project implements a simple console-based application in C++ that addresses the problem by providing the following functionalities:

1. **Display All Charging Stations**: 
   - Users can view a list of all available charging stations, including their location, type (Fast/Slow), and the number of available slots.

2. **Filter Charging Stations**: 
   - Users can filter charging stations based on the type of charger (Fast/Slow) to find the most suitable option for their needs.

3. **Book a Charging Slot**: 
   - Users can book a charging slot at a specific charging station. The system checks for slot availability and confirms the booking if a slot is available.
